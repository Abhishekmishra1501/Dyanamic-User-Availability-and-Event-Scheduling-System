# Dyanamic-User-Availability-and-Event-Scheduling-System
 Design and develop a web-based application that allows users to dynamically set their availability for specific days or the entire week. The admin should be able to view this availability and schedule sessions accordingly. Sessions can be one-on-one or involve multiple participants. The focus should be on creating a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.
